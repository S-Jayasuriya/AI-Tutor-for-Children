Ashoka gave up war after seeing many people grieving death after the Kalinga war. He embraced Buddhism and then devoted his life to spread the message of peace and dharma. His service for the cause of public good was exemplary. He was the first ruler to give up war after victory. He was the first to build hospitals for animals. He was the first to lay roads. Ashoka Chakra with 24 spokes in our national flag was taken from the Sarnath Pillar of Ashoka.\nEven though Emperor Ashoka was great, his greatness \nhad been unknown until 19th century.The material evidence provided by William Jones, James Prinsep and Alexander Cunningham revealed the greatness of Emperor Ashoka.\nBased on these accounts, Charles Allen wrote a book \ntitled The Search for the India\u2019s Lost Emperor, which \nprovided a comprehensive account of Ashoka. Many researches made thereafter brought Ashoka\u2019s glorious \nrule to light.

But our ancestors did not live in such a safe environment. There might have been chances of wild animals \nentering their caves.

Development of brain.\nHomo sapiens who migrated out of \neastern Africa settled in different parts of the world. Their lifestyle also evolved and they made it suitable to the environs in which they lived. So humans in different places adopted different forms of lifestyle. Based on the weather, climate and nature of the living place, their physique and complexion also differed. This resulted in the formation of different races. Human procreation resulted in an increase in the population.Tamilini:  Grandma, it\u2019s  fantastic.\nGrandma: Yes, it is. I shall now explain \nto you in detail how the Homo sapiens \nengaged in hunting and gathering.\nHunting and Food Gathering\nTamil, you will be surprised to know \nthat millions of years ago, our ancestors led \na nomadic life. They lived in groups in a cave or a mountain range. Each group consisted of 30 to 40 people. They kept on moving in search of food. They hunted pig, deer, bison, rhino, elephant and bear for food. They also ate the animals killed by other wild animals like tiger. They learnt the art of fishing. They collected honey from beehives, plucked fruits from the trees and dug out tubers from the ground. They also collected grains from the forest. Once the food resource got exhausted in one area, they moved to another place in search of food. They wore hides of animals and barks of trees and leaves for protecting their bodies during winter. So humans began \nhunting to satisfy their need for food.\nHunting Methods\n1. Go as a group and hunt the prey. 2.  Dig a pit and trap the animals and hunt.HOTS\nWhy did humans become hunter-gatherers? Did the landscape play \nany role?\nwww.tntextbooks.in",

Can \nyou tell me about hunting practices?\nStone Tools and Weapons\nGrandma: Hunting was the main \noccupation of humans in the past. It was \ndifficult for humans to kill a big animal with a stick or a stone. So they decided to use sharpened weapons.\nThe best stone for the making weapons \nwas chikki \u2013 mukki kal (flint). It is known for its strength and durability. Humans spent many hours in search of a flint stone. They made sharp weapons and tools with the help of the stones and fitted them with wood to grip them. Humans created tools \nlike axes with big  stones.\nTamilini:  Why were axes made, grandma?\nGrandma: The axes were made to cut \ntrees, remove barks, dig pits, hunt animals and remove the skin of animals.\nGrandma: Tamil, do you know what \nthe next stage was after \nmaking stone tools?\nTamilini:  I don\u2019t know \ngrandma.

    "page23": "125\nAt first, humans were afraid of fire \nand lightning. Probably fire caused by \nlightning had killed many wild animals. Humans tasted the flesh of the killed animals, which was soft and tasty. This made humans aware of the effect of fire. They used flint stone to make fire and used it to protect them from predators, for cooking food and for creating light during night. Thus fire became important for man in olden times.\nHOTS\nIs there any object that can bring heat \nand fire other than a match box?\nTamilini: What next, grandma?\nGrandma:  You will be surprised to \nknow that the next human invention was the wheel. This was the first scientific invention of humans using their brain and cognitive skills.\nInvention of the Wheel\nThe invention of wheel by humans is \nconsidered to be the foremost invention. When humans saw the stones rolling down \nfrom the mountains, probably they would have got the idea of making the wheel.\nPot Making\nHumans l earned to make pot with \nclay. The invention of wheel made pot \nmaking easier, and the pots made were burnt to make it stronger. They decorated pots with  lot of colours. The colour dyes were made from the extracts of roots, leaves or barks. These natural dyes were used in rock paintings.\nGrandma:  Can you identify what is in \nthis picture?\nHunting scene in which men and  \nwomen are taking part \nTamilini:  Yeah. Some blurred tweaks are seen. Someone has drawn.\nGrandma:  No, this is our ancestor\u2019s \nhandwork. In fact, it is the first art of humanity. Before the use of language, humans expressed their feelings through actions and also recorded it in rock paintings.Even today in the \nvillages of Nilgiris district in Tamil Nadu, people have the habit \nof making fire without use of match box.\nwww.tntextbooks.in",

Thus agriculture and farming came into existence. They domesticated the animals and used them in their farming.\nBreeding of animals now became an \nimportant part of their life. Oxen were used for ploughing. Oxen made the practice of agriculture easier. Life was becoming organised than it was, when they were hunting. It enabled them to settle down in a place. Now with settlement came the problem of utensils and vessels for cooking and storage. The potter\u2019s wheel and fire solved this problem.\nThe invention of plough helped the \nfarming practices. Farming started with the clearing of land and burning the left-over shrubs. They ploughed the land, sowed seeds in them and harvested the produce. Ancient Rock Paintings\nIn India, we can see many paintings \nin rocks and caves. The rock paintings \ngive some information about the past. Approximately there are 750 caves, in which 500 caves have paintings. There are many more undiscovered caves. The rock paintings depict hunting pictures of the male and the female, dancing pictures and pictures of children playing.\nTamilini:  Oh! We are able to gain some \nknowledge about the past lifestyle through \nthese paintings. Isn\u2019t it, Grandma?\nGrandma: You said it rightly, Tamil. \nThese rock and cave paintings tell us \nmany stories about our ancestors.\nTamilini:  Okay, grandma! Now tell me \nhow humans reached the next stage.\nGrandma: There were many dangers \ninvolved in hunting. Due to large-scale \nhunting in the mountain areas and in the forests, many animals became extinct. Non availability of meat forced the humans to look for fruits and vegetables for food.\nTamilini: Now they would have thought \nof producing food for themselves. Is it \nnot grandma?\nFrom Nomadic to Settled Life : The \nWorld\u2019s Earliest Farmers\nGrandma:  Very well said, Tamil. The \nseed of fruits and the nuts they ate were \nthrown into the soil. During rains, the soil gave it life. Some days later, the saplings sprouted from the soil. By observation and logic, they learn that: \na. a plant grows from a single seed and yields lots of fruits and vegetables. \nwww.tntextbooks.in",
    "page25": "127\nDuring the pre historic period, humans lived in caves and depicted their daily events \nin drawings. Mostly pictures of animals were drawn.\nOnce the fertility of the soil decreased, \nthey moved to a new place. Initially agriculture was done for immediate food requirement. Later when they found out ways to increase production, they started storing the produce. The food products stored were used during the lean harvest periods. By their experience, they understood that land close to the river side \nwas suitable for farming. So they decided to stay there permanently.\nTamilini: How about domestication of \nanimals, grandma?Grandma: Humans thought of ways \nto better their skills at hunting.

Thus dogs became the first animal to be domesticated by humans. Following the dogs, they started domesticating hen, goat and cow.\nTamilini:  What next?\nGrandma: Humans stayed on the plains \nfor a long time. During this period, they \nhave not only learnt agriculture, but slowly developed skills of handicraft. Permanent settlement in a place increased the yield of crops. Now they had grains in excess of what they consumed. The surplus grains were exchanged with other groups for the other things they were in need of. This is called the barter system. Thus trade and commerce developed and towns and cities emerged.\nTamilini: Thank you, grandma.

This was the earliest historical record of the existence of Harappa.\nIn 1856 \nwhen engineers \nlaid a railway line connecting Lahore to Karachi, they discovered more burnt bricks. Without understanding their significance, they used the bricks for laying the rail road.\nIn the 1920s archaeologists began to \nexcavate the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro. They unearthed the remains of these long-forgotten cities. In 1924 the Director General of ASI, Sir John Marshall, found many common features between Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro.

The male character Kovalan\u2019s father is Maasathuvan. Massathuvan means a big trader. It is clear from the text that Poompuhar was a place where big traders and sea traders had settled down.\nNumerous merchants from foreign \ncountries such as Greece and Rome landed at Poompuhar. Due to busy and continuous trade, many of them stayed on indefinitely in Poompuhar. There are evidences of foreigner's settlements in the town. People speaking many languages inhabited Poompuhar in its glorious days. As loading and unloading of ships took some months, the foreign traders began to interact with the local people during that period. This enabled the natives to learn foreign languages for communication. Similarly, the foreigners also learnt Tamil to communicate with the natives. This contact facilitated not only exchange of goods but also languages and ideas resulting in cultural blending.\nThe traders of Poompuhar were known \nfor their honesty and integrity. They sold goods at legitimate prices. Pattinappaalai  \nstates that \u201cselling any commodity at a \nhigher price was considered bad\u201d.\nThe author of Pattinappaalai, \nKadiyalur Uruttirangannanar, belonged to \n2\nnd century BC(BCE).

Gold that came from Vadamalai was polished and exported to the overseas countries. Sandal from Western Ghats, pearls from southern sea, corals from eastern sea and food items from Eelam were imported.\nPoompuhar had been built differently \nfrom other towns. Each social group had a separate settlement. Streets were broad and straight, dotted with well-designed houses. There was also a dockyard.\nWe can learn about the life of the \npeople of Puhar by reading Pattinappaalai and \u201cPuhar Kandam\u201d of Silappathikaram.\nPuhar was a busy port upto 200 AD(CE). \nIt might have been either washed away by sea or destroyed by big shore waves.

Jains studied in Jainapalli, \nand Buddhists studied in Viharas.\nThe greatness of Kanchi as an \neducational centre can be understood from the fact that the Chinese traveller Hieun Tsang who studied at Nalanda Madurai\nMadurai has been one of the oldest \ncities in India. Its antiquity can be \nunderstood from the sobriquet \u201cSangam \nValartha Nagaram\u201d it has earned. \nPandyas, the Cholas and later the \nKalabras ruled Madurai in the ancient period. During medieval times, later Cholas and later Pandyas followed by the Nayaks ruled this historic town. This has resulted in cultural blending. Trade flourished and evidence for this has been unearthed in archaeological excavation done in Keezhadi near Madurai.\nMadurai is proudly associated with \ntamil sangam (academies), which worked for the promotion of Tamil language.  \nForty-nine poets were associated with the \nThoonga Nagaram\nMadurai had Naalangadi and Allangadi.\nNaalangadi \u2013 Day Market.Allangadi    \u2013 Evening Market.Madurai is known as Thoonga \nNagaram (the city that never sleeps). Madurai was a safe place where women purchased things from Allangadi without any fear.\nwww.tntextbooks.in",

During the later period, Kanchi came to be known as the district of lakes. Water management skills of the ancient Tamils can be understood from the construction of Kallanai in the Chola country and the lakes and canals in Kanchi.\nApart from Poompuhar, Madurai \nand Kanchi, there were other towns too in ancient Tamilagam. Korkai, Vanchi, Thondi, Uraiyur, Musiri, Karuvur,  Mamallapuram, Thanjai, Thagadoor and Kaayal are some of them.

Kanchi is the oldest town in Thondai Nadu.  Scholars like Dharmabalar, Jothibalar, Sumathi and Bodhi Dharmar were born in Kanchi.\nKanchi is also known as the temples city. \nThe famous temple of great architectural beauty, Kailasanathar temple, was built by later Pallava king Rajasimha at Kanchi. During the Pallava period, a large number of cave temples were built. The Buddhist monk Manimegalai spent the last part of her life at Kanchi speaks highly of that town.\nWater management played an  \nimportant role in the agrarian society \nHieun Tsang\n\u2022 Poompuhar  was a port.\n\u2022 Madurai was a trading town.\n\u2022 Kanchi was an educational \ncentre.\nwww.tntextbooks.in",

It is self-luminous; \nit gives light on its own. The surface temperature of the Sun is about 6,000\u00b0 C. It is the source of light and heat energy to the entire solar system. Sunlight takes about 8.3 minutes to reach the Earth.\nPlanets\nThe word 'planet' \nmeans wanderer . \nThere are eight planets \nin the solar system. They are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. All the planets rotate anti-clockwise (from west to east) on their own axes except Venus and Uranus. The elliptical path in which the planets move around the Sun is known as orbit. The eight planets revolve in their respective orbits because of the gravitational pull of the Sun. They do not move out of their paths or away from the solar system.\nThe four planets nearer to the Sun \nare called Inner or Terrestrial Planets  \n(Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars). The inner planets are comparatively smaller in size and are composed of rocks. The surface of inner planets has mountains, volcanoes and craters. The last four planets are called as Outer Planets or Jovian Planets  (Jupiter, \nSaturn, Uranus, and Neptune). They are also called Gaseous Giants .

Is it in the same place throughout the day? No. It is seen in the east in the morning, overhead in the afternoon and in the west in the evening. Have you ever thought of the reason behind it? This is because of the constant moving of the Earth around the Sun. It seems that the Sun is moving, but it is not so. This is similar to what you experience when you are travelling in a bus or train. When you look out of the window, the trees, lamp posts and other objects seem to be moving, but actually it is you who are moving. To understand the motions of the Earth better, you need to be familiar with the shape and inclination of the Earth.\nShape and Inclination of the Earth\nThe Earth is spherical in shape. It \nrotates on its axis, which is an imaginary \nline that runs from the North Pole to the South Pole passing through the centre of the Earth. The Earth\u2019s axis is always tilted or inclined from the vertical by an angle of 23\u00bd\u00b0. It makes an angle of 66\u00bd\u00b0 with the plane of the Earth\u2019s orbit. \nThe velocity of the Earth\u2019s rotation varies from 1,670 km per hour at the equator to 845 km per hour at 60\u00b0 N and S latitudes and zero at the poles.Fact:Rotation\nIt is the spinning \nmovement of the Earth on its axis. The Earth rotates from west to east (anti-clockwise) and takes 23 hours \n56 minutes and \n4.09 seconds to \ncomplete one rotation. The time taken by the Earth to complete one rotation is called a day. The rotation of the Earth causes day and night. As the Earth is spherical in shape, only one half of it is illuminated by the Sun at a time. The other half remains dark. The illuminated portion of the Earth experiences day, whereas the darkened part of the Earth experiences night. The line which divides the surface of the Earth into a lighted half and a dark half is called the Terminator Line .\nThe Midnight Sun  is a natural \nphenomenon that occurs in the summer months in places north of the Arctic Circle or south of the Antarctic Circle, when the Sun remains overhead 24 hours a day. Fact:\nRevolution\nIt is the movement of the Earth \naround the Sun on its elliptical path. The Earth takes 365 \u00bc days to complete one revolution. It revolves around the Sun at a speed of 30 km per second. For the sake of convenience, we take it as 365 days and \nwww.tntextbooks.in",

Aphelion \nis the farthest position \nof the Earth from the Sun. \nOn 21st June, the Tropic of Cancer \nfaces the Sun. This is known as Summer \nSolstice . It is the longest day in the \nNorthern Hemisphere and longest night (shortest day) in the Southern Hemisphere. On 22\nnd December, the Tropic \nof Capricorn faces the Sun.

It has three major \ncomponents that we call as the realms of the Earth- lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere. The three components along with suitable climate make life possible on Earth. All living things exist in a narrow zone called the biosphere. Now let us have a close look at each of the spheres.\nLithosphere\nThe word lithosphere is derived from \nthe Greek word Lithos, which means \nrocky. The Lithosphere is the land on \nwhich we live. It is the solid outer layer of the Earth consisting of rocks and soil.\nHydrosphere\nThe word Hydro means water in \nGreek. The hydrosphere consists of water \nbodies such as oceans, seas, rivers, lakes, ice caps on mountains and water vapour in the atmosphere.\nAtmosphere\nThe word Atmo  means air in Greek. \nAtmosphere is the envelope of air that \nsurrounds the Earth. Different types of gases make up the atmosphere. The major gases are Nitrogen (78%) and Oxygen (21%). The other gases like Carbon dioxide, Hydrogen, Helium, Argon and Ozone are present in meager amounts. Biosphere\nThe narrow belt of interaction among \nthe lithosphere, the hydrosphere and the atmosphere, where life exists is known as Biosphere. Bio means life in Greek. It \nconsists of distinct zones. Each zone has its own climate, plant and animal life. These zones are known as ecosystems.\nThe Gulf of Mannar \nBiosphere Reserve in the Indian Ocean covers an area of 10,500 sq.km  \n     in the ocean.\nSummary\n \u0099The Universe was formed 15  billion  \nyears after the Big Bang explosion\n \u0099Many galaxies are found in the \nUniverse.\n \u0099Our solar system is a part of the Milky Way Galaxy.\n \u0099The Sun is so huge that it accounts for 99.8 percent of the entire mass of the solar system.\n \u0099All planets rotate anti-clockwise on their own axes except Venus and Uranus.\n \u0099Asteroids are found as a belt between Mars and Jupiter.\n \u0099The rotation of the Earth causes day and night.\n \u0099The revolution of the Earth causes seasons.\n \u0099Summer solstice is the longest day in the Northern Hemisphere.\n \u0099The presence of land, water and air along with suitable climate makes life possible on Earth.\nwww.tntextbooks.in",

India has all of them. India is known as a sub-continent. These features have an underlying influence upon the people who live in different landforms of the country.\nPhysical and climatic features \ndetermine the economic activities of a region. People living in the plains thrive on agriculture, while people in the coastal areas take to fishing for their livelihood. In mountainous regions, rearing of animals is undertaken. Hilly landscapes are supported ways, yet we live together. This is known as diversity.\n2. Diversity in India\nIndia is a home to a civilisation that \nis 5,000 years old. Different groups of people from different parts of the world were attracted towards India over the years because of its wealth. Some came for trade with the local people and others were keen on invading its territory. So diverse races of people migrated into India by land and sea routes over time. Thus the Dravidians, Negroids, Aryans, Alpines and Mongoloids became part of the modern Indian race. Then, the people who migrated to India also moved to other parts of the country. This movement and migration of people is the reason for India\u2019s rich diversity.\nWe will now study the diversity in \nIndia under the following broad headings: \nUNITY IN DIVERSITY\nwww.tntextbooks.in",

Families live in a harmonious neighbourhood. Many of neighbourhoods collectively form a village and many of them group together in a city. The needs of people and the interdependence of communities for amenities such as water, food, electricity, education, housing and so on bring us together to live in harmony. Though we are diverse in our cultural practices, we are united and interdependent socially.\n2.3 Religious Diversity\nIndia is a secular country. It does not \ndeclare any religion as state religion. The freedom of religion is our fundamental right. India is the birth place of many religions \nToda tribal people.and has become the home of many others. Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism, Jainism and Zoroastrianism flourish in India.\nIndia is a land of festivals, where \npeople from different religions engage in many colourful celebrations in different parts of the country and co-exist harmoniously. The wide variety of festivals celebrated in India is a true manifestation of its rich culture and traditions.

Since we believe in \u2018Unity in Diversity\u2019, we should have been living peacefully with one another irrespective of those differences. Often, we see that diversity is not accepted, and people show attitudes of hostility towards those who are \u2018different\u2019 from them. They form opinions about the other groups and this often leads to tension in the society. Such \u2018opinions\u2019 are often \u2018prejudiced\u2019.\n1. Prejudice\nPrejudice means to judge other people \nin a negative or inferior manner, without knowing much about them. It happens when people have false belief and ideas.\nPrejudice   \n   Pre 1  JudgeThe word \u2018prejudice\u2019 refers to \nprejudgement. Prejudices can be based on many things like people\u2019s religious beliefs, the region they come from, the colour of their skin, language, their accent or the clothes they wear. The types of prejudice are gender prejudice, racial prejudice, class prejudice, disability prejudice and so on.\nFor example, urban people are more \ncivilised than rural people in attitudes and behaviour, is one such prejudice.\n1.1 Causes for Prejudice\nSome common social factors that \ncontributes to the rise of prejudice are\n1.

Stereotype is a false view or idea about something. For example, \ngirls are not good  at sports. Ster eotype \nis learned at a very early age, and \nchildren grow to have  very strong ideas \nor opinions about  things, gr oups or \nideologies. As  children grow up, the lines \nof like and  hate for other things, people, \ncultures, beliefs, languages become sharper.\nExample\nRagu was hit in his eye \nwith a soft ball and to \neveryone\u2019s surprise, he started to cry. The others started to laugh at him; Mani felt sad for him but started laughing along with others.\nIn the above example, we have a \ngeneral opinion that girls cry and boys don\u2019t cry. When Ragu cried out of pain, others laughed at him. Now we understand that when we fix people in our image, we create a stereotype. \nGender-based stereotypes are often \nportrayed in films, advertisements and TV serials. Almost all the advertisements related to detergents, washing \nmachines,  dishwashers and others show \na woman as the main lead or user of that product. On the other hand, all the \nEnd of Apartheid\nAfter 27 years in prison, former South African President, \nNelson Mandela, was freed in 1990 and succesfully achieved the end of apartheid in South Africa, bringing peace to a racially divided country and leading the fight for human rights around the world.\nstunts shown in a bike advertisement is \nperformed by ferocious looking men.\n3. Inequality and Discrimination\nInequality means difference in treatment. \nThe different forms of inequalities such as caste inequality, religious inequality, race inequality or gender inequality give rise to discrimination.\nDiscrimination can be defined as \nnegative actions towards people. Inequality and untouchability are caused by discriminations based on caste, religion and gender. Treating dark-skinned people differently from fair-skinned people, and denying equal status, rights and opportunities on the basis of colour, caste, gender, religion etc. are the formidable discriminatory trends afflicting India.\nArticle 15(1) of the Constitution states \nthat the State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds of religion, \nrace, caste, sex, place of birth.\nwww.tntextbooks.in",

In some families, girls are not allowed to wear modern dresses while boys in such families often wear modern dresses.\n3.3 Religious Discrimination\nReligious discrimination is unequal \ntreatment of an individual or group based \non their beliefs. Religious discrimination has been around for a long time. There have been problems between people of different religions for thousands of years. Our Constitution has provided equality for all irrespective of their caste, religion, language, place of birth etc. Yet discriminations are still in practice even in worship places on the basis of caste, religion, gender and language. Our great social thinkers have been crusading against such discriminations and inequalities.3.1 Caste Discrimination\nCaste system is the most dominant \nreason for inequality and discrimination in India. The caste system originated in the Varna system of the Vedic Aryan society. In the beginning Varna was an occupation based flexible social division. In the Later Vedic Society, the Varna system was expanded into a rigid, discriminatory, birth based graded caste divisions. \nMany people in India have fought against \ncaste oppression. The most prominent among them was Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. He belonged to a such depressed family and suffered discrimination throughout his childhood. He fought actively for the annihilation of caste so as to ensure equality among all the citizens of India.\n3.2 Gender Discrimination\nGender discrimination refers to \nhealth, education, economic and political \ninequalities between men and women. For example, A girl is not allowed to go Dr. B.R. Ambedkar\n\u2022 He is popularly known as Baba Saheb.\n\u2022  He was an Indian jurist, economist, politician and \nsocial reformer.\n\u2022  He earned his M.A. in 1915 and then obtained a D.Sc at the \nLondon School of Economics before being awarded Ph.D by Columbia University in 1927.\n\u2022 He served as the chairman of drafting committee of the constituent assembly and hence regarded as the father of Indian Constitution.\n\u2022 He was independent India\u2019s first Law Minister.\n\u2022 He was posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna in 1990.\nwww.tntextbooks.in",
